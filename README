NAME
    Debian::Apt::PM - locate Perl Modules in Debian repositories

NOTE
    EXPERIMENTAL => "use at your own risk"; # you have bin warned

SYNOPSIS
    Cmd-line:

            apt-pm update
            apt-pm find Moose
            dpkg-scanpmpackages /path/to/debian/repository

    Module:

            my $aptpm = Debian::Apt::PM->new(sources => [ 'PerlPackages.bz2' ])
            $aptpm->update;
            my %moose_locations = $aptpm->find('Moose');

USAGE
  COMMAND-LINE USAGE
    Add sources for Debian releases and components. Here is the complete
    list that can be reduced just to the wanted ones:

            cat >> /etc/apt/sources.list << __END__
            # for apt-pm
            deb http://dbedia.com/Debian/mirror/ etch    main contrib non-free
            deb http://dbedia.com/Debian/mirror/ lenny   main contrib non-free
            deb http://dbedia.com/Debian/mirror/ sid     main contrib non-free
            deb http://dbedia.com/Debian/mirror/ squeeze main contrib non-free
            __END__

    Fetch the indexes:

            apt-pm update

    Look for the CPAN modules:

            apt-pm find Moose
            # libmoose-perl_0.17-1_all: Moose 0.17
            # libmoose-perl_0.94-1_i386: Moose 0.94
            # libmoose-perl_0.97-1_i386: Moose 0.97
            # libmoose-perl_0.54-1_all: Moose 0.54

    Look for the non-CPAN modules:

            apt-pm find Purple        
            # libpurple0_2.4.3-4lenny5_i386: Purple 0.01
        
            apt-pm find Dpkg::Version
            # dpkg-dev_1.14.28_all: Dpkg::Version 0

METHODS
  new()
    Object constructor.

    PROPERTIES
    sources
        `isa => 'ArrayRef'' of files that will be read to construct the
        lookup. By default it is filled with files from
        /var/cache/apt/apt-pm/.

  find($module_name, [$min_version])
    Returns hash with Perl versions as key and hash value having Debian
    version and package name. Example:

            {
                    '0.94' => {
                            'version' => '0.94-1',
                            'package' => 'libmoose-perl'
                            'arch'    => 'i386'
                    },
                    '0.97' => {
                            'version' => '0.97-1',
                            'package' => 'libmoose-perl'
                            'arch'    => 'i386'
                    },
                    '0.54' => {
                            'version' => '0.54-1',
                            'package' => 'libmoose-perl'
                            'arch'    => 'i386'
                    },
            };

    If `$min_version' is set, returns `min' and `max' keys. `max' has always
    the highest version:

            'max' => {
                    'version' => '0.97-1',
                    'package' => 'libmoose-perl'
                    'arch'    => 'i386'
            },

    `min' is changing depending on `$min_version'. Examples:

            $min_version = '0.01';
            'min' => {
                    'version' => '0.54-1',
                    'package' => 'libmoose-perl'
                    'arch'    => 'i386'
            },
            $min_version = '0.93';
            'min' => {
                    'version' => '0.94-1',
                    'package' => 'libmoose-perl'
                    'arch'    => 'i386'
            },
            $min_version = '1.00';
            'min' => undef,

  update
    Scans the /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list
    repositories for PerlPackages.bz2 and prepares them to be used for find.
    All PerlPackages.bz2 are stored to /var/cache/apt/apt-pm/.

  clean
    Remove all files fom cache dir.
